                <h5>What You Should Know</h5>
                <p> My name is Ronald Nubah. I am a senior at Kennesaw State University majoring in Interactive Design. 
                    A little about me is that I was born in Ghana and came to the United States at around two years old and have lived in Georgia since I was three years old. 
                    I currently live in Buford, Georgia. 
                    I make songs as a hobby, love video games, and physical activities, and am a car enthusiast. </p>
                    <p>My experience at KSU has been great. 
                       I originally came in as undeclared in fall 2020 and before the end of my first semester, I had to choose my major. 
                       I had chosen criminal justice to be a lawyer and stuck with it for 3 semesters until spring 2022. I had never attended a class on campus because all my classes were online. 
                       Then I took a semester off after realizing I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore I switched my major to Interaction Design in spring 2023 and am attending campus in person. 
                       In this major I learn about building user interfaces and what goes into this design-making process. 
                       It is challenging to attend school because I commute from Buford,GA to Kennesaw,GA but I am pleased with that decision and have enjoyed my experience on campus. </p>
